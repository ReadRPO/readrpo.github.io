## Markdown
Markdown is used opposed to alternatives such as Asciidoc or HTML and CSS for better readability and editting. Asciidoc _can_ be compiled to Markdown via Asciidoctor, however the styling accuracy is arguable. The readability may be better for the language, but the editting is painful. HTML and CSS face the same difficulties as Asciidoc.

## Privacy
Midas Touch - GitDoc does not use any analytics, and pledges to protect your privacy. The default remote Google fonts were removed and now rely on the system/browser rendering. Our website without JavaScript as the search bar requires this object. However, the search bar functions locally, and the code is open-sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/midastouch-mt/midastouch-mt.github.io).
